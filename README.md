This repository is for all the codes that I use in learning the codes

*The codes and all the material given here is produced by LUCIFER-OVERRIDDEN and can contain error, if you actually wanna learn how to code you can follow these repository commands and get a good grip on basic commands of the programming language*

```python

def learning(method):
  if method == practising:
    print("You're doing good \n keep it up")
  elif method != practising:
    print("You should start practising daily to improve your coding skills")
```

also

```C
void learning();

int main()
{
  learning();
  return 0;
}

void learning()
{
  if(method == practising)
  {
    printf("You're doing a great job \n Keep it up")
  }
  
  elseif (method != practising)
  {
    printf("You should start practising daily to improve your coding skills");
  }
}
```
